# Weather Planner

### Description  
A web app that lets the user search the week's forecast for their ideal weather scenario.

**User scenario:**  
I want to plan a time to go camping but am reliant on the weather. With the app, I could select my ideal camping weather conditions - no rain, minimum temperature of 55Â°, sunny, low wind - and the app will show me which upcoming dates meet my requirements.

**Please note, this project's functionality relies on TWO repositories, ui-weather-planner and [api-weather-planner](https://github.com/clkcompton/api-weather-planner.git) repositories.**
