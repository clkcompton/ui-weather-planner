# Weather Planner

**Description:**
A weather app that lets the user search future dates for their ideal weather scenario.

Example: I want to plan a time to go camping but am reliant on the weather. With the app, I could select my ideal camping weather conditions - no rain, on a weekend, sunny, low wind - and the app will show me which upcoming dates meet my requirements.
